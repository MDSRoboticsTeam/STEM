I've added some comments to explain what is happening and the basics of programming in the C language

If you log into [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) via Google you can save your projects.
Also consider joining the [Wokwi Channel](https://discord.com/channels/787627282663211009/) on Discord for help and ideas - My username is Oblio, the users there are very helpful

[Arduino (Processor board) Reference page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) has lots of information and examples on the function calls (e.g. digitalRead() ) used in the code.

Lastly - If you have time, play around with Hello World, decreasing and increasing the time the LED is on and off.  

* What happens when the time between blinks is very short?
* If the time is very short, what happens when the time on is greatly different from time off?  (hint:  you may need to have separate on and off time variables)
* Change the ratio of the times on and off and see what happens.
* When you do this, make sure the Gamma for the LED is 1.0 in the json file (diagram.json file is next to the code file (sketch.ino))
* Feel free to experiment with switches, buttons, and other parts.  If you click on a part (when the simulation is stopped) look for the ? and click on it for help and examples.
* If you save your code, message me on Discord with a link (see the Share button to get the link) so I can check it out.
* Have Fun!!

I'll see if I can bring in some actual Arduino boards, buttons, and LEDs so we can run with real hardware.
