# Basic LED Output

Several projects to demonstrate driving a simple LED output circuit.  Fritzing breadboad and schematic are in Blink.fzz  Setup includes hardware for the code projects below and a simple manually switched LED.


* Blink

  Demonstrates basic output by blinking a single LED
* PWM

  Illustrates the use of a simple function that toggles a digital output pin at a prescribed on and off time to perform simple Pulse Width Modulation
* Dim

  Demonstrates the use of analogWrite() to automatically create a PWM waveform to change LED intensity
