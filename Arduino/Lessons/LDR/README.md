# Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)

*Description in work*
## Voltage Divider Circuit

A simple way to use an LDR is to measure the change in voltage across the LDR as the light changes.  To demonstrate how this is done, we will examine a simple voltage divider with fixed resistors.  We will then apply this concept to a variable resistor, in this case an LDR.

The image below is a simple voltage divider. The Arduino part can simply be considered a 5 Volt voltage source as those are the only terminals that the circuit is connected to.  If we wanted to, we could relace the Arduino with a 5V battery and the results would be the same.

## Voltage across each Resistor 

According to Ohm's law, the total current is the voltage (5V) divided by the total resistance (10220)
